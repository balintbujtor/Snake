# snake
Simple snake game made for fun written in Python.

This game was originally intended to be the homework for one of my AI courses, but it turned out that it would have been too complex to implement this for that course. Instead, I just finished this Snake game that I had always wanted to implement. Nothing fancy, just a game, for myself. Although, I learned a lot about pygame and graphics.
